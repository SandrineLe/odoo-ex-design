#### What do you find good/bad in this mock-up?

Overall, the design is very nice, efficient and the color scheme is consistent and relevant with the "product". There is a logical hierarchy and we can easily understand the structure.

#### What would you improve? What would you change?

I would personally change a few minor elements of the banner and the "infinite solutions" section in order to make it more impactful and striking.

*The banner:* I would add a light gradient (though a vibrant one could also be okay) to the background to so it can look stronger design wise and I would also change the background of the button "Get started +" so it can really capture the users' attention.

*The infinite solution section:* I would also add a light gradient to the background.
